                Going off of the 1950s Disney film, Cinderella is about the story of a young girl, whose father is recently widowed and remarries to another widow who has two preexisting daughters. After her father passes away, her livelihood drastically changes as her stepmother basically turns her into a maid in her own house. Meanwhile, the local Prince and his father invite all of the kingdom's maidens in hopes of finding a new Princess to wed the soon to be of age Prince. In fear of Cinderella possibly being chosen from the lineup, the stepmother distracts Cinderella with menial chores to prevent her from attending. However, despite her being busy and also later being sabotaged by her sisters, she encounters a Fairy Godmother.

                When she meets the Fairy Godmother, she provides her with a new gown and glass slippers and her own coachmen to accompany her to the ball. However, the magic comes with a catch as it will become ineffective at the stroke of midnight. When Cinderella arrives, she immediately catches the attention and affection of the Prince, who becomes infatuated with her. They hit it off, but unfortunately Cinderella loses track of time and leaves in a rush as the magic wears off at midnight, thus leaving behind one of her glass slippers.

                Distraught at his future wife running away for no apparent reason, the Prince calls for an audition from every girl in the kingdom to find who fits the supposed glass slipper of his love. Cinderella's stepmother then realizes that she is in fact the same girl that the Prince is looking for and locks her in the house's attic to prevent her from being wed off, as well as breaking the glass slipper after her daughters fail to fit the shoe. Thankfully, Cinderella, after escaping, reveals she owns the remaining half of the glass slippers which the Prince faithfully puts on her, and later marrying Cinderella.
